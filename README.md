# ECG-Diagnosis

Project Description:

This project focuses on diagnosing heart wave patterns using image classification techniques with machine learning. The system analyzes electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to identify irregularities or abnormalities in the heart's electrical activity, which may indicate various cardiac conditions.

The model categorizes ECG signals into four main cardiac conditions:

Myocardial Infarction
History of Myocardial Infarction
Abnormal Heartbeat
Normal ECGs
